# PROBLEM 01A (25 points)
# Uncomment the variable name and assigned value that adheres to the styling
# convention described in PEP 08 for function and variable names
# (see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names)
# Choose wisely or you will trigger a syntax error.

# Hint: uncomment = remove hash symbol ('#') and any leading whitespace in front
# of the variable name.

# BEGIN 01A SOLUTION
# class = 'SI 506'
# course name = 'SI 506'
# $course_name = 'SI 506'
# course_name = 'SI 506'

# Next, append the text ": Programming I" to the value of the variable
# selected above using the appropriate operator. Write code on next line.


# Next write a print() statement that prints the variable value to the
# screen. Write code on next line.


# Next determine the number of characters of your new string value using
# the appropriate builtin function. Assign the value to the variable
# num_chars (replace default value of 0):
num_chars = 0

# Note use of the built-in str() function to format num_char_chunks as a string.
print(''.join(['num_chars=', str(num_chars), '\n']))
# END 01A SOLUTION
