# PROBLEM 01A (25 points)
# Uncomment the variable name and assigned value that adheres to the styling
# convention described in PEP 08 for function and variable names
# (see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names)
# Choose wisely or you will trigger a syntax error.

# Hint: uncomment = remove hash symbol ('#') and any leading whitespace in front
# of the variable name.

# Guido van Rossum is the original author of Python and former
# Benevolent dictator for life (BDFL) of the project.

# BEGIN 01A SOLUTION
# 1st_bdfl = 'Guido van Rossum'

# python author = 'Guido van Rossum'
# python_author = 'Guido van Rossum'
# lambda = 'Guido van Rossum'

# END 01A SOLUTION


# PROBLEM 01B (25 points)
# Use the appropriate operator to append (i.e., concatenate) Guido's current position
# at the Python Software Foundation (see https://www.python.org/psf/members/#officers)
# to the value assigned to the variable you chose you in Problem 01A. Assign
# the concatenated value to the variable python_foundation_officer.

# Adopt the following format for the new string:
# "<name>, President"

zen_of_python = """Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"""

# PROBLEM 01C (25 points)

# PROBLEM 01D (25 points)
# Count the number of "words" separated by whitespace (word is used
# figuratively since not all the character chunks you will encounter are
# actually words) in the string assigned to the variable zen_of_python
# and assign the value to the variable num_char_chunks.

# PROBLEM 01E (25 points)
# Use floor division to divide num_char_chunks by 19 (i.e., the number of lines
# in the Zen of Python). Return an integer rather than a floating point value.

# PROBLEM 01F (25 points)
# Substitute your U-M email address for all occurrences of the word "Dutch" using
