# SI 506: Problem Set 01

This week's problem set includes six (6) one to two line problems that focus on variables 
creation and value assignment, string concatenation, use of arithmetic operators, and use 
of certain built-in functions discussed in the lectures and the readings.

Retrieve the problem set 01 template file at 
[https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2019Fall/code/gradescope/problem_set_01.py](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2019Fall/code/gradescope/problem_set_01.py)

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your 
`problem_set_01.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime 
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many 
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described 
in the syllabus.

The general layout of a SI 506 problem set resembles the following:

```python
# START PROBLEM SET 01
print('PROBLEM SET 01 \n')

# PROBLEM 01A (25 points)
# Instructions for problem 01A provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN 01A SOLUTION

# Write your 01A solution between the BEGIN/END comments. 

# Not that for certain problems a required variable may be 
# initialized with a default value (e.g., var_int = 0, var_str = '') 
# that you will then change. print() statements are occasionally 
# provided as a courtesy in order to output variable values 
# to the screen.

# END 01A SOLUTION


# START PROBLEM 01B SETUP (do not modify)

# WARNING: For some problems a "setup" section is included in order
# to provide variables, functions or other working code for use 
# with the problem(s). Do not change any code located between
# START/END SETUP.

# END SETUP

# PROBLEM 01B (25 points)
# Instructions for problem 01A provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN 01B SOLUTION

# Write your 01B solution between the BEGIN/END comments. . . . 

# END 01B SOLUTION

# Additional problems will follow, structured similarly to problems 01A and 01B above.

# END PROBLEM SET
