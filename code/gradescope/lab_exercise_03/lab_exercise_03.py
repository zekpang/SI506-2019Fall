# SETUP - We provide you with a select list of UMSI faculty. In the future, such data
# will be provided in a file which you will read into Python with some useful functions. However,
# for today, the teaching team has provided this list for you to use.
#
# Data description:
#d
# Each item in the umsi_faculty list is a string containing the name, title, and email address of
# the faculty member. Each piece of information relating to the faculty member is separated by a
# pipe ('|') delimiter.

umsi_faculty = ["Charles Severance|Clinical Professor of Information|csev@umich.edu",
                "Colleen Van Lent|Lecturer|collemc@umich.edu",
                "Chris Teplovs|Lecturer|cteplovs@umich.edu",
                "Anthony Whyte|Lecturer|arwhyte@umich.edu",
                "Christopher Brooks|Research Assistant Professor|brooksch@umich.edu"]

# END SETUP


# PROBLEM 1
# Part I. Extract the second item in umsi_faculty using its index value and assign it to a new
# variable named collemc.
# Part II. Extract the last element in umsi_faculty using its index value and assign it to a new
# the variable named brookcsh.

# BEGIN PROBLEM 1 SOLUTION

collemc = None
brookcsh = None

# END PROBLEM 1 SOLUTION


# PROBLEM 2
# Use list slicing to extract the 2nd, 3rd and 4th items from the list umsi_faculty and save
# the items to a new list called lecturers.

# BEGIN PROBLEM 2 SOLUTION

lecturers = []

# END PROBLEM 2 SOLUTION


# PROBLEM 3
# There are two parts to this problem:
# Part I. Extract each faculty member's email addresses from the umsi_faculty list and append the
# extracted email address to the list named email_addresses.

# Hint : You can use loops, split() and list slicing to craft your solution. Use print() statements to debug.

# BEGIN PROBLEM 3 SOLUTION
email_addresses = []

# Part II. Using an if statement, check the length of each email address in the list.
# If the length of the email address is greater than ('>') 15 characters, extract the
# email address and append it to a new list called long_email_addresses.
long_email_addresses = []

# END PROBLEM 3 SOLUTION

# END LAB EXERCISE
